# Matrix SDK for Elm (alpha)

This repository is an alpha version of the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) SDK for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) compatible with [these spec versions](src/Internal/Api/README.md).

This alpha version is highly experimental. It has been replaced by a [beta version repository](https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk-beta).

## How to install

This repository does not have its first version released! For now, you will need to install this library manually if you wish to use it.

## Why Elm?

As a functional programming language that promises zero runtime exceptions and great optimized performance, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a web application language that allows you to write reliable web applications or tiny programs.

This means that Elm makes it relatively easy to create all kinds of programs in almost no time!
